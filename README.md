# Task Requirements

 - Create project using new version custom development tool Chisel. Check out the documentation for the new version.
 - Convert design and make it responsive using your best judgement.
 - Create a hover effect for the image thumbnails.
 - Create a simple custom overlay for photos - you can use an external JavaScript library for it.
 - Allow to choose thumbnail shape from the 2 predefined shapes (circle, square) in the WordPress admin and enter enough sample images to demonstrate the effect.
 - Set up a virtual host with your project repository name (eg. yourname-fewp-test.test) so we don't have search & replace URLs when testing your project.
 - Store the whole WordPress installation into the test repository. Store a database dump to it as well and a zip with upload folder with images used in the project.

# Overview

Project files can be imported in for eg. in IDE like: 'Visual Studio Code' or 'PHP Storm'. Project files require to have 'Node JS', 'Composer' and 'Chisel' tool installed on your system. You can get 'Chisel' at: [https://www.getchisel.co/docs/development/wordpress/](https://www.getchisel.co/docs/development/wordpress/). Next or you have to do is 'npm install' to get all project dependencies and you are good to go.
